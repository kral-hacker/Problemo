            <p> <b>=) Why didn't the Russian Empire become the dominant world power in regards to technology, science, culture, etc.?</b><br><br>
            ::) The Russian Empire’s failure to become the dominant world power in terms of technology,
               science, and culture  can be attributed to a combination of internal and external factors
               The Russian Empire, spanning from the 16th to the early 20th century, was a vast and powerful entity with significant influence
                in Europe and Asia. However, despite its size and military might, it did not emerge as the dominant world power in terms of 
                technology, science, and culture for several reasons.
               Additionally, the Russian Empire faced challenges in education and literacy. <br>While efforts were made to improve 
               education during the 19th century, particularly under Tsar Alexander II, literacy rates remained relatively low compared to
                Western Europe. This lack of education hindered the development of a strong scientific and technological base.
               One key factor was the empire's political and social structure. The Russian Empire was characterized by 
               autocratic rule, with power centralized in the hands of the tsar. This centralized authority limited innovation and progress
                in various fields. Unlike Western Europe, where the Renaissance and Enlightenment periods fostered intellectual and cultural
                 advancements, Russia lagged behind in embracing these movements due to its conservative political climate.
              Furthermore, the Russian Empire struggled with economic modernization.
              that hindered its growth and development on the global stage ..</p><br>

              ::) Despite older model PCs lacking various modern features like modern CPU’s and GPU’s, there are various
               features that newer PCs cannot replace:
                Software Optimization - Now, software at the time may not have been best optimized but due to 
                all the software bloat thanks to poor software developers and IDE’s, a computer program from 2006 will indefinitely 
                play much more swiftly compared to one today in 2024.

            <b>=) Do you know how to get over depression?</b><br><br>
            ::) Hey there! So, about beating the blues? Yep, I've got my own way that does the trick for me,
             though it's not a one-size-fits-all kind of deal. There's a whole bunch of science backing up the idea 
             that hitting the weights and getting your sweat on can seriously help with anxiety and depression. 
             For me, it's like a secret weapon. Here's my game plan: daily cardio to get the heart pumping and a 
             couple of weightlifting sessions a week. And by weightlifting, I mean getting down with the barbells and sprinkling 
             in some bodybuilding moves for extra spice. Take squats, for instance. Spending 30 minutes adding weights
